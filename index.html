    <p>Resources for the 'Shine Design' Creative Computing Club.</p>
    <p>During this workshop, you will create a light-up design to decorate the <a href="https://scienceoxford.com/centre/" target="_blank">Science Oxford Centre</a> for the <a href="https://www.oxlightfest.com/" target="_blank">Oxford Light Festival</a>.</p>
    <p>This page recaps what <a href="https://bit.ly/Nov21CCC" target="_blank">we discussed as a group</a>.</p>
    <p>To skip to the examples and ideas, <a href="#extensions">click here</a>.</p>

  <div id="starter" class="left">
    <h3>Creating your first micro:bit program</h3>
    <p>Open <a href="https://codewith.mu/" target="_blank">the Mu editor</a> on your computer. <strong>If there is code on the screen</strong>, start a New program from the menu.</p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScienceOxford/cyber-pet/master/images/mu_toolbar_new.png" alt="Mu menu, highlighting 'New'" width="1000px" height="auto">
    <p>Type these two lines of code into your blank window:</p>
    <pre>from microbit import *
display.show(Image.HAPPY)</pre>
    <br>
    <p>Plug your micro:bit into the computer, then click Flash:</p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScienceOxford/cyber-pet/master/images/mu_toolbar_flash.png" alt="Mu menu, highlighting 'Flash'" width="1000px" height="auto">
    <p>Some code should be running on your micro:bit!</p>
    <p><strong>If you get a message scrolling across the micro:bit's screen</strong>, this is an error message!</p>
    <p><strong>Debug</strong> your code, then click Flash again to test your changes.</p>
    <p>Once your code is working - change it!</p>
    <p>Instead of <code>HAPPY</code>, can you think of another <code>Image</code> the micro:bit could <code>show</code> on its <code>display</code>?</p>
    <br>

  <div id="wiring-LED" class="left">
    <h3>Connecting an LED</h3>
    <p>The 'teeth' on the bottom of the micro:bit allow you to add extra components to your designs.</p>
    <p>To start with, we will add a single LED.</p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScienceOxford/ElecKit/master/images/LED_wiring.JPG" alt="LED wiring photo" width="600px" height="auto">
    <p>Take a crocodile clip, and connect one end of it to <strong>pin 0</strong> on your micro:bit.</p>
    <p>Connect the other end of your crocodile clip to the <strong>positive</strong> lead of your LED (the longer one).</p>
    <p>Connect a second crocodile clip between the <strong>GND pin</strong> on your micro:bit, and the <strong>negative</strong> lead of your LED (the shorter one).</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="coding-LED" class="left">
    <h3>Coding an LED</h3>
    <p>Add the below code to your micro:bit program, underneath everything you have done so far... what happens to your LED?</p>
    <pre>while True:
    pin0.write_analog(1023)
    sleep(500)
    pin0.write_analog(0)
    sleep(500)</pre>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>What happens if you use a number lower than <code>1023</code>?</li>
        <li>What do you need to change to make your LED flash faster, or slower?</li>
        <li>What would you need to change in the code if you connected the LED to <strong>pin 1 or 2</strong> instead of pin 0?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="wiring-RGB" class="left">
    <h3>Wiring an RGB LED</h3>
    <p>With a regular LED, you must choose a single colour.</p>
    <p>An RGB LED has four legs, and is three LEDs in one. You can <strong>mix</strong> the colours to make any colour you want.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Disconnect your previous LED from the crocodile clips - leave them attached to the micro:bit though.</p>
    <p>Find the long leg of the RGB LED, this one is the negative, and connect the crocodile clip attached to your micro:bit's GND pin to it.</p>
    <p>Use your other crocodile clip to test out the three legs of the LED - which leg makes which colour?</p>
    <br>
    <p>ADD PICTURE OF WIRING HERE</p>
    <br>
    <p>Get two more crocodile clips and connect them up so that pins 0, 1 and 2 on the micro:bit all have a clip.</p>
    <p>Connect up your LED so that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>pin0 = red leg of RGB LED</li>
        <li>pin1 = green leg of RGB LED</li>
        <li>pin2 = blue leg of RGB LED</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="coding-RGB" class="left">
    <h3>Coding an RGB LED</h3>
    <p>Now that we have three colours in one, the code will get more complicated.</p>
    <p>To make it easier to see what is going on, we are going to use <strong>variables</strong> to rename the micro:bit's pins (0, 1, 2) to the colours they are attached to.</p>
    <p>Add the following lines of code to your program, <strong>before</strong> the <code>while True</code> loop:</p>
    <pre>red = pin0
green = pin1
blue = pin2</pre>
    <br>
    <p>Inside your <code>while True</code> loop, your current code turns pin0 on and then off again. Change <code>pin0</code> to <code>red</code> and flash your code to your micro:bit - does the RGB LED flash red?</p>
    <p>Your code should look something like this so far:</p>
    <pre>from microbit import *

red = pin0
green = pin1
blue = pin2

while True:
    red.write_analog(1023)
    sleep(500)
    red.write_analog(0)
    sleep(500)</pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Expand your code</strong> to add the two other colours, like this:</p>
    <pre>from microbit import *

red = pin0
green = pin1
blue = pin2

while True:
    red.write_analog(1023)
    green.write_analog(1023)
    blue.write_analog(1023)
    sleep(500)</pre>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Now experiment!</strong></p>
    <p>What different colours can you make by changing the brightness of the red, green and blue lights?</p>
    <br>
  </div>

    <h3>What next?</h3>
    <p>Now that you know how to connect lights to a BBC micro:bit, your imagination (and our supplies!) is your limit.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We have strings of fairy lights, which you can connect instead of a single LED.</li>
        <li>You could attach three seperate LEDs and make interesting patterns.</li>
        <li>You could use craft supplies to turn your design into a decoration for the Light Festival - try making a lantern from lolly sticks and paper!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The links below give you some other ideas of things you could add to your design.</p>
